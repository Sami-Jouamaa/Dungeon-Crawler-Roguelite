# Dungeon-Crawler-Roguelite
StS-PoE-DungeonCrawler mix

At the start of each run, you will be able to select a class, each with a separate tree and a distinc set of skills. 
Each run has up to 5 levels, each levels having a layout of areas, those areas can contain a combat whose difficulty is distributed depending on where in the level it is placed, you can also have a town where you can shop, some random events granting you special exploration areas, some stronger fights exclusive to the pool of events. At the mid-way point, there will a stronger fight against some special enemies (elite fights like in StS) and at the end of the level, a boss fight selected among four different ones.

Combats and sometimes events will reward you with gear, the level of which will depend both on the level you are at and your class's level too. This gear will increase attributes, armour, resistances to different elements, crit chance, etc. It will also be able to grant you some special skills that would otherwise only be reserved to another class or to your own but at a much later level.

At the end of a run, you will get exp based on how far you got, how many combats (normal, elite and boss) you have completed, how many events you have completed and the amount of gold accumulated throughout the run. 

Each level up with a class will grant you a point in their specific skill tree, enhancing their kind of damage and their kind of preferred weapon type, every three levels, a new skill will be unlocked to be equipped at the start of a run.

Skills can be equipped at the start of a run and during the run between acts and during some special events too. Up to 8 skill slots with a basic attack and the skills granted by gear will not occupy one of these slots.
